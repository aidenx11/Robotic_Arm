# Robotic_Arm
---
Repository for code for my robotic arm, built in C++ with an Arduino UNO. It is an articulated arm with three degrees of freedom. Ideally a wrist will be added later. The arm operates using 9g micro servos mapped to potentiometers. The servos are powered from a PCA9685 servo controller, using PWM from the Arduino.

A video of the arm moving some small boxes and a photo from above are attached below.
